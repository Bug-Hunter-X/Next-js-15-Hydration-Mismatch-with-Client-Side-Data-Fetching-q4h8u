# Next.js 15 Hydration Mismatch Bug Report

This repository demonstrates a hydration mismatch error in Next.js 15 when fetching data on the client-side within a dynamic route.  The error arises from discrepancies between client-side and server-side rendering due to asynchronous data fetching.

## Bug Description

A hydration mismatch occurs when the client-side rendering of the component doesn't match the server-side rendering. In this case, the `About` page fetches data from an API. If the data fetching is not handled properly, the client-side will render with different content than what the server initially rendered, leading to the error.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to `/about`.
5. Observe the hydration mismatch error in your browser's console.

## Solution

The solution involves using a strategy to ensure that the client-side and server-side rendering match.  This is typically done by employing techniques such as data fetching during server-side rendering or using a loading indicator while waiting for data.
